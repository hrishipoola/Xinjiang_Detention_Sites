# Xinjiang_Detention_Sites

Since 2017, China has instituted the mass internment of >1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other people in Muslim-majority groups in Xinjiang province. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) recently released results from The Xinjiang Data Project (https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/), which uses satellite imagery and local government working group documents to locate, map, and analyze 380 suspected detention sites. It also details the destruction of >16,000 mosques and demolition of 30% of important Islamic cultural sites across southern Xinjiang. Recently, The Economist (https://www.economist.com/china/2020/10/17/how-xinjiangs-gulag-tears-families-apart) and FT (https://www.ft.com/content/6cceb0c1-dc43-48a4-81cc-2debcac0148a) drew from the work and, through interviews, featured chilling added detail of separated families, orphaned children, forced labor, sterilization, and cultural indoctrination.

Today, we'll plot the number of detention sites for each of the 21 prefectures (sub-provincial), create an interactive zoom & pop-up map of all 380 detention sites using folium highlighting location, name, and security tier, and plot the number of detention buildings by type and year. In addition to working with the dataframe, we'll work with plot styling, grids, and colormaps. The purpose is to visualize the extent and ongoing expansion of the internment program for the public and data scientists interested in digging deeper. If you'd like to explore more on Xinjiang's cultural erasure, including additional visual satellite assets, documents, and data current to September 2020, you can find it here (https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/data/).
